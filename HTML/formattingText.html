    <h1>Basic Template</h1>
    <h2> Paragraphs </h2>
      <p>
        Here, I can write paragraphs. Any amount of information, but it's solely text.
        Nothing will be styled unless I use CSS to change the font, the font size, color,
        etc.
      </p>
    <h2> Headings </h2>
      <p>
        I can have different types of headings. The Title of this webpage is with h1 heading.
        This is the largest size. We can go up to h6 heading sizes.
      </p>
    <h2> Bold/Italics </h2>
      <p>
        we use "strong" to <strong> bold </strong> words. We can also italicize in two ways.
        One way is to use the <i> i element tag </i> or the <em> em </em> tag. Em gives
        emphasis and shows the urgency of the italicized word.
      </p>
    <h2> Lists </h2>
      <p>
        Lists can be ordered and unordered. An ordered list will produced list items with numbers
        while unordered lists will have bullets. Each item must be surrounded by li (or list item)
        tags.
        Example:
          <ul>
            <li> flour </li>
            <li> egg   </li>
          </ul>
          <ol>
            <li> flour </li>
            <li> egg   </li>
          </ol>
      </p>
      <h2> Quotes </h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          We can also have things called blockquotes. This would surround the
          multiple lines of text that are quotes (even if held in paragraph format).

          For example, this paragraph is assumed to be a large block quote and we will cite
          it using the cite tag.
          <cite> Megana C </cite>
          The q attribute will place <q>quote </q> marks around your regular quotes.
          Additionally if your  paragraph element has a language attribute attached, the q element will
          use the respective syntax for the quotation marks.
        </p>
