      Here, I can write paragraphs. Any amount of information, but it's solely text.
      Nothing will be styled unless I use CSS to change the font, the font size, color,
      etc.

    <p>
      I can have different types of headings. The Title of this webpage is with h1 heading.
      This is the largest size. We can go up to h6 heading sizes.
