    <h1> Chapter 4: Links and Navigation </h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      Building off from formattingText.html file. Chapter 3 does not have an exercise
      file. I will summarize that information briefly here and continue adding to the rest of the document
      regarding information in Chapter 4 (copying and pasting some info from previous file to build upon).
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2> Chapter 3 synopsis </h2>
    <p>
      DOM tree - Document Object Model. Builds a tree based upon the syntax of the HTML file.
      We can use developer tools on webpage to debug.

      <br>
      Attributes are modifiers to the element tag. For instance, we talked about the lang attribute for
      the paragraph element to set the language being used or typed.
      <br>
      Common attributes
      <br>
      <code> class </code> - gives a reusable name that can be used in CSS or Javascript, used by paragraph
      <br>
      <code> id </code> -target unique element and use only once to be targeted by CSS or Javascript, used by paragraph
      <br>
      <code> contenteditable = "true" </code>, used with blockquote

      <br>
      <br>

      Aria roles are used to make it easier for the impaired. Think of random graphic example and how the Aria
      modifier allowed us to understand the graphic was just saying HelloWorld

    <h2> Chapter 4 Content </h2>
      <br>
      <h3> Links </h3>
        <p>
          Links are created by the a element tag and then the href attribute. Syntax is as follows.
          <br>
          <code> <strong> &lt;a href = "https://www.google.com"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; </strong> </code>
          <br>
          anything in between the a tags would be the clickable link to the site.
          Example: <a href = "https://www.google.com"> click here </a>
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two types of URLs - absolute and relative.
          <br>
          <strong> Absolute </strong> - direct path to another domain site (going from my page to google)
          <br>
          <strong> Relative </strong> - within the same domain or site (on CNN and going to an article within the site)
          <br>
          If I know file structure I can find where the local file is (same as finding file in terminal with slashes and directory locations)
          <a href = "/formattingText.html"> Try this </a>
          <br>
        <h3> Navigation Bar </h3>
          <p>
            use nav element tag around list to create navigation pane. Or use footer
            element for navigation at bottom
            <br>
            <nav>
                <ul> <!-- will need to add class label to CSS style how this nav bar looks, right now it's just a list -->
                  <li> <a href = "/formattingText.html"> Chapter 2 </a> </li>
                  <li> <a href = "/linkNavigation.html">Chapter 3/4 </a></li>
                </ul>
            </nav>
          </p>
  </body>
</html>
